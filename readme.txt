myCred Rank Plus gives you the power to add rank types and set multiple rank requirements including priority and sequential control, and more.

== Description ==

**myCred Rank Plus** is a powerful add-on that allows the admin to add new rank types that will be awarded to their website users as rewards. This add-on is an enhanced version of the built-in Ranks add-on. 

Ranks give your users something to strive towards and a little more motivation. Awarding ranks when your users perform well or progress in tasks increases user engagement, revenue, and traffic on your website.  

myCred Rank Plus gives you the power to use the Rank Plus Gutenberg Blocks, to design the ranks single page.
